**OVERVIEW OF PROJECT**
**Project Overview**:**Diabetes Prediction**

This assignment targets to develop a predictive model which could diagnose diabetes based on numerous affected person traits. The model is educated on the PIMA Diabetes dataset, which incorporates information about patients with and without diabetes.

Key Objectives:

Data Collection and Analysis: Load and explore the PIMA Diabetes dataset to understand the traits of diabetic and non-diabetic patients.
Data Preprocessing: Standardize the information to make certain that every one capabilities are at the equal scale.
Model Training: Train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier at the preprocessed facts to predict diabetes.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the version using accuracy rankings on both schooling and trying out facts.
Predictive System: Create a predictive gadget that takes in patient traits as input and predicts whether the affected person is diabetic or now not.
Dataset:

PIMA Diabetes Dataset: A publicly to be had dataset containing data about sufferers with and with out diabetes.
Features: 8 patient characteristics, including age, sex, frame mass index (BMI), blood strain, and others.
Target Variable: Outcome (0 = non-diabetic, 1 = diabetic)
Methodology:

Data Loading and Exploration: Load the dataset right into a Pandas DataFrame and discover the records the usage of numerous methods (e.G., head(), shape, describe(), value_counts()).
Data Preprocessing: Standardize the information the use of StandardScaler to ensure that all functions are at the same scale.
Train-Test Split: Split the preprocessed information into training and checking out units using train_test_split.
Model Training: Train an SVM classifier at the schooling facts using svm.SVC.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the overall performance of the model the usage of accuracy ratings on each education and testing data.
Predictive System: Creat
